          We meet up on the first and third Wednesday evening of each month. We
          might just go to the pub, have an informal game of softball on the
          common, or try go karting or white-water rafting!

          Nearly always on the first and third Wednesday of each month. The
          venue isn't fixed, however. It could be in a local pub or restaurant,
          at a nearby sports facility, or at an activity in London or closer to
          home.

          It's definitely the fundraising. No, hang on, it's seeing people's
          smiles at the carnival or Santa sleigh visit. Or maybe it's making
          new friendships that will last for years. You'd better ask a few of
          us individually and hear what we each say!

          Not as far as we're aware! No secret meetings, initiation rituals, no
          funny handshakes. We're just a group who want to get out and meet
          people, do a bit for the community, but mostly have fun along the
          way.

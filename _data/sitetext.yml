          We meet up on the first and third Wednesday evening of each month. We
          might just go to the pub, have an informal game of softball on the
          common, or try go karting or white-water rafting!

          Nearly always on the first and third Wednesday evenings of the month.
          The venue isn't fixed, however. It could be in a local pub or
          restaurant, at a nearby sports facility, or at an activity venue in
          London (or closer to home).

          It's definitely the fundraising. No, hang on, it's seeing people's
          smiles at the carnival or Santa sleigh visit. Or maybe it's making
          new friendships that will last for years. You'd better ask a few of
          us individually and hear what we each say!

          Not that we know about! No secret meetings or bizarre initiation
          rituals either. We're just a group who want to get out and meet
          people, do a bit for the community, and have fun along the way.

          Yes! Get in touch using the form below and come along to one of our
          social events as a guest. It's a great way to meet a few of the group
          and learn more about us.

          Nearly always on the first and third Wednesday evenings of the month.
          The venue isn't fixed, however. It could be in a local pub or
          restaurant, or at a nearby sports facility or activity venue.

          Everyone has a different view. For some it's the fundraising. For
          others it's seeing people's smiles at the carnival or Santa sleigh
          visit. For many it's making new friendships that will last for years.
          Come along and ask a few of us individually!

          Definitely not. No secret meetings or bizarre initiation rituals
          either. We're just a group who want to get out and meet people, do a
          bit for the community, and have fun along the way.
